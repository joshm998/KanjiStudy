# KanjiStudy
Kanji Study is a Blazor C# .NET 6 application that I developed to help Japanese language learners in studying the Kanji that are listed in Heisigâ€™s Remembering the Kanji Book. The application uses a Spaced Repetition System with the SuperMemo Algorithm, this has all been developed using Blazor WebAssembly and can be run on the client without the need for any servers.

The application is also using a CI/CD pipeline built on GitHub Actions, which allows for a new version of the application to be deployed when PRs are merged into the master branch. For the styling I ended up using Tailwind CSS for its ease of use and premade CSS examples for certain parts of the site.

I developed this application to help me along my Japanese language learning journey and to finally play around with Blazor WebAssembly and see what it could do. Overall I found Blazor to be extremely useful and writing C# for the web without needing a server, a novel experience.

I have recently also created an Electron version of the application and uploaded it to the Snap Store so I could use it on the desktop instead of in the browser.
